<blockquote><p>Every responsible nation gathers up and promotes its values from fields such as science, education, and culture. Currently, there are 3,000 Romanian students in the UK, joined by an impressive number of researchers, professors, doctors, artists and architects. There are almost 600 Romanian doctors and nurses working in the British national healthcare system. Promoting the Romanian values is essential, it being a part of the European civilisation values. Solid education leads to the development of a nation. </p></blockquote>
