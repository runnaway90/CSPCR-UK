Current ToDos during refactoring:

================ General ==================        
- Ouvert, Schneider and Schwarz should be only available in hand games
- Show ouvert cards of another player 
- Click on last card on a hand is not always recognized
- i18n on all parts of the GUI 
- Option for browsing all tricks of a game

================== ISS ====================        
- recognize invitation from other players
- give up/accept give up during a game
- show cards to other players during a game

Old ToDos before refactoring:

================ questions ==================        
- What is the interpretation of skatGame and skatRound in the JSkatDataModel?
  How does that relate to the terms "skat round" and "skat game" from the gui?
  To what German terms do these translate? There should be three levels (suggestion): 
  1) (Gesamt-)Spiel <=> match (?) ==> 1..n rounds
  2) Runde          <=> round     ==> three or four games (in JSkat currently three)
  3) (Einzel-)Spiel <=> game      ==> a single game (except for ramsch grand hand)

[JS] This is correct, should be reflected in class structure.

================ must =======================        
- [JS ][old       ] lock the game rule options after a game has been started (i.e. ramsch game rules)
- [JS ][old       ] "Schneider", "Schwarz" and "Ouvert" should only be available when playing hand
- [JS ][old       ] Number of rounds to play is not set (NewSkatRound vs. Options!)
        (is this still the case? seems to work now [2006-04-16])
- [JS ][2006-04-16] changing the language in the options dialog doesn't have any effect
- [JS ][2006-04-16] Introduction of new class SkatMatch that stands for a whole
        match on a JSkatTable with 1..n rounds
- [JS ][2006-04-25] using new enums introduced in Java 1.5 for coding game type, card color and rank etc.
		see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html for more information

================ should =====================        
- [JS ][old       ] layout of JSkat options
- [JS ][old       ] add ramsch option: don't consider skat (as an additional radio button)
- [JS ][old       ] add option if contra is allowed without bidding 18
- [JS ][2006-04-16] add icons for "flip cards" and "last trick"
- [JS ][2006-04-16] mark the player which is next by either an icon or a special color at the name
        (so that you can actually see that it's your turn)
- [JS ][2006-04-16] add safety question when abandoning a running skat round
- [MJL][2006-04-16] make a nicer game over dialog
- [JS ][2006-04-16] clean up the table after the game is finished (i.e. after "Game Over")

================ nice to have ===============        
- [JS ][old       ] accept a click anywhere in the card panel to clear the table
- [JS ][2006-04-16] change icon for "about"
- [JS ][2006-04-16] remember window position and size in properties for the next start
- [JS ][2006-04-16] make an option for counting the points
- [all][2006-04-18] write a more detaled javadoc, especially for the AIPlayer Interface
- [MJL][2006-04-18] Replace System.out.println in JUnit classes by debug statements
        
================ postponed ==================        

================ done =======================        
- [JS ][2006-04-16] AIPlayerBBMC does not comply with the rules!!!
- [MJL] handle "Jungfrau"
- [MJL] handle "Durschmarsch"
- [MJL] check ruleset (whether its ISPA rules or pub rules)
- [JS ] integrate additional ramsch options
- [JS ] add option whether Jacks in a Schieberamsch are allowed
- [JS ] add option field for grand hand option to ramsch options
- [JS ] add option if grand hand question should be asked in ramsch games
- [JS ] disable bock and ramsch rules when playing by ISPA rules
- [JS ] make sure that no Jacks are in the skat if this option is not enabled
        (TODO check when a HumanPlayer changes the cards)
- [JS ] fix Revolution option
- [JS ] create a round separator in the scoreboard (to show which games belong to a round)
        (either by a new column with the round # or by using different background colors)
- [all] add grand hand option to ramsch
- [MJL][2006-04-16] add a default log4j.properties file [was already there]
